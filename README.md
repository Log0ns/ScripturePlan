# Minimal Scripture Reader

A new method for reading through the Bible.

## How It Works

- You get icons—each one tracks a Bible reading path.
- **Tap** an icon to go to the next chapter.
- **Hold** an icon to:
  - Pick where it starts (book + chapter).
  - Optionally set an end point so it loops within a range.
- You can add up to **10 icons**, each with its own reading plan.
- Everything is saved **locally** on your device—no accounts or cloud stuff.

## Design

- Background and icon colors change with the time of day (morning, afternoon, evening, night).
- Minimal UI with soft gradients and blur effects for a peaceful reading vibe.

## Built With

- **React + TypeScript**
- **Tailwind CSS**
- **Lucide Icons**
- Local storage for saving progress

git clone https://github.com/your-username/scripture-reader.git
